       Displays paths that have differences between the
       index file and the current HEAD commit, paths
       that have differences between the working tree
       and the index file, and paths in the working tree
       that are not tracked by Git (and are not ignored
       by ggiittiiggnnoorree(5)). The first are what you _w_o_u_l_d
       commit by running ggiitt ccoommmmiitt; the second and
       third are what you _c_o_u_l_d commit by running _g_i_t
       _a_d_d before running ggiitt ccoommmmiitt.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -s, --short
           Give the output in the short-format.

       -b, --branch
           Show the branch and tracking info even in
           short-format.

       --show-stash
           Show the number of entries currently stashed
           away.

       --porcelain[=<version>]
           Give the output in an easy-to-parse format
           for scripts. This is similar to the short
           output, but will remain stable across Git
           versions and regardless of user
           configuration. See below for details.

           The version parameter is used to specify the
           format version. This is optional and defaults
           to the original version _v_1 format.

       --long
           Give the output in the long-format. This is
           the default.

       -v, --verbose
           In addition to the names of files that have
           been changed, also show the textual changes
           that are staged to be committed (i.e., like
           the output of ggiitt ddiiffff ----ccaacchheedd). If --vv is
           specified twice, then also show the changes
           in the working tree that have not yet been
           staged (i.e., like the output of ggiitt ddiiffff).

       -u[<mode>], --untracked-files[=<mode>]
           Show untracked files.

           The mode parameter is used to specify the
           handling of untracked files. It is optional:
           it defaults to _a_l_l, and if specified, it must
           be stuck to the option (e.g.  --uunnoo, but not
           --uu nnoo).

           The possible options are:

           •   _n_o - Show no untracked files.

           •   _n_o_r_m_a_l - Shows untracked files and
               directories.

           •   _a_l_l - Also shows individual files in
               untracked directories.

           When --uu option is not used, untracked files
           and directories are shown (i.e. the same as
           specifying nnoorrmmaall), to help you avoid
           forgetting to add newly created files.
           Because it takes extra work to find untracked
           files in the filesystem, this mode may take
           some time in a large working tree. Consider
           enabling untracked cache and split index if
           supported (see ggiitt uuppddaattee--iinnddeexx
           ----uunnttrraacckkeedd--ccaacchhee and ggiitt uuppddaattee--iinnddeexx
           ----sspplliitt--iinnddeexx), Otherwise you can use nnoo to
           have ggiitt ssttaattuuss return more quickly without
           showing untracked files.

           The default can be changed using the
           status.showUntrackedFiles configuration
           variable documented in ggiitt--ccoonnffiigg(1).

       --ignore-submodules[=<when>]
           Ignore changes to submodules when looking for
           changes. <when> can be either "none",
           "untracked", "dirty" or "all", which is the
           default. Using "none" will consider the
           submodule modified when it either contains
           untracked or modified files or its HEAD
           differs from the commit recorded in the
           superproject and can be used to override any
           settings of the _i_g_n_o_r_e option in ggiitt--
           ccoonnffiigg(1) or ggiittmmoodduulleess(5). When "untracked"
           is used submodules are not considered dirty
           when they only contain untracked content (but
           they are still scanned for modified content).
           Using "dirty" ignores all changes to the work
           tree of submodules, only changes to the
           commits stored in the superproject are shown
           (this was the behavior before 1.7.0). Using
           "all" hides all changes to submodules (and
           suppresses the output of submodule summaries
           when the config option
           ssttaattuuss..ssuubbmmoodduulleeSSuummmmaarryy is set).

       --ignored[=<mode>]
           Show ignored files as well.

           The mode parameter is used to specify the
           handling of ignored files. It is optional: it
           defaults to _t_r_a_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l.

           The possible options are:

           •   _t_r_a_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l - Shows ignored files and
               directories, unless --untracked-files=all
               is specified, in which case individual
               files in ignored directories are
               displayed.

           •   _n_o - Show no ignored files.

           •   _m_a_t_c_h_i_n_g - Shows ignored files and
               directories matching an ignore pattern.

           When _m_a_t_c_h_i_n_g mode is specified, paths that
           explicitly match an ignored pattern are
           shown. If a directory matches an ignore
           pattern, then it is shown, but not paths
           contained in the ignored directory. If a
           directory does not match an ignore pattern,
           but all contents are ignored, then the
           directory is not shown, but all contents are
           shown.

       -z
           Terminate entries with NUL, instead of LF.
           This implies the ----ppoorrcceellaaiinn==vv11 output format
           if no other format is given.

       --column[=<options>], --no-column
           Display untracked files in columns. See
           configuration variable column.status for
           option syntax.----ccoolluummnn and ----nnoo--ccoolluummnn
           without options are equivalent to _a_l_w_a_y_s and
           _n_e_v_e_r respectively.

       --ahead-behind, --no-ahead-behind
           Display or do not display detailed
           ahead/behind counts for the branch relative
           to its upstream branch. Defaults to true.

       --renames, --no-renames
           Turn on/off rename detection regardless of
           user configuration. See also ggiitt--ddiiffff(1)
           ----nnoo--rreennaammeess.

       --find-renames[=<n>]
           Turn on rename detection, optionally setting
           the similarity threshold. See also ggiitt--
           ddiiffff(1) ----ffiinndd--rreennaammeess.

       <pathspec>...
           See the _p_a_t_h_s_p_e_c entry in ggiittgglloossssaarryy(7).

OOUUTTPPUUTT
       The output from this command is designed to be
       used as a commit template comment. The default,
       long format, is designed to be human readable,
       verbose and descriptive. Its contents and format
       are subject to change at any time.

       The paths mentioned in the output, unlike many
       other Git commands, are made relative to the
       current directory if you are working in a
       subdirectory (this is on purpose, to help cutting
       and pasting). See the status.relativePaths config
       option below.

   SShhoorrtt FFoorrmmaatt
       In the short-format, the status of each path is
       shown as one of these forms

           XY PATH
           XY ORIG_PATH -> PATH

       where OORRIIGG__PPAATTHH is where the renamed/copied
       contents came from. OORRIIGG__PPAATTHH is only shown when
       the entry is renamed or copied. The XXYY is a
       two-letter status code.

       The fields (including the -->>) are separated from
       each other by a single space. If a filename
       contains whitespace or other nonprintable
       characters, that field will be quoted in the
       manner of a C string literal: surrounded by ASCII
       double quote (34) characters, and with interior
       special characters backslash-escaped.

       For paths with merge conflicts, XX and YY show the
       modification states of each side of the merge.
       For paths that do not have merge conflicts, XX
       shows the status of the index, and YY shows the
       status of the work tree. For untracked paths, XXYY
       are ????. Other status codes can be interpreted as
       follows:

       •   ' ' = unmodified

       •   _M = modified

       •   _A = added

       •   _D = deleted

       •   _R = renamed

       •   _C = copied

       •   _U = updated but unmerged

       Ignored files are not listed, unless ----iiggnnoorreedd
       option is in effect, in which case XXYY are !!!!.

           X          Y     Meaning

           ?           ?    untracked
           !           !    ignored
           -------------------------------------------------

       Submodules have more state and instead report M
       the submodule has a different HEAD than recorded
       in the index m the submodule has modified content
       ? the submodule has untracked files since
       modified content or untracked files in a
       submodule cannot be added via ggiitt aadddd in the
       superproject to prepare a commit.

       _m and _? are applied recursively. For example if a
       nested submodule in a submodule contains an
       untracked file, this is reported as _? as well.

       If -b is used the short-format status is preceded
       by a line

           ## branchname tracking info

   PPoorrcceellaaiinn FFoorrmmaatt VVeerrssiioonn 11
       Version 1 porcelain format is similar to the
       short format, but is guaranteed not to change in
       a backwards-incompatible way between Git versions
       or based on user configuration. This makes it
       ideal for parsing by scripts. The description of
       the short format above also describes the
       porcelain format, with a few exceptions:

        1. The user’s color.status configuration is not
           respected; color will always be off.

        2. The user’s status.relativePaths configuration
           is not respected; paths shown will always be
           relative to the repository root.

       There is also an alternate -z format recommended
       for machine parsing. In that format, the status
       field is the same, but some other things change.
       First, the _-_> is omitted from rename entries and
       the field order is reversed (e.g _f_r_o_m _-_> _t_o
       becomes _t_o _f_r_o_m). Second, a NUL (ASCII 0) follows
       each filename, replacing space as a field
       separator and the terminating newline (but a
       space still separates the status field from the
       first filename). Third, filenames containing
       special characters are not specially formatted;
       no quoting or backslash-escaping is performed.

       Any submodule changes are reported as modified MM
       instead of mm or single ??.

       Version 2 format adds more detailed information
       about the state of the worktree and changed
       items. Version 2 also defines an extensible set
       of easy to parse optional headers.

       Header lines start with "#" and are added in
       response to specific command line arguments.
       Parsers should ignore headers they don’t
       recognize.

           If ----bbrraanncchh is given, a series of header
           lines are printed with information about the
           current branch.

               Line                                     Notes

           Following the headers, a series of lines are
           printed for tracked entries. One of three
           different line formats may be used to
           describe an entry depending on the type of
           change. Tracked entries are printed in an
           undefined order; parsers should allow for a
           mixture of the 3 line types in any order.

           Ordinary changed entries have the following
           format:

               1 <XY> <sub> <mH> <mI> <mW> <hH> <hI> <path>

           Renamed or copied entries have the following
           format:

               2 <XY> <sub> <mH> <mI> <mW> <hH> <hI> <X><score> <path><sep><origPath>

               Field       Meaning
               --------------------------------------------------------
               <XY>        A 2 character field containing the staged and
                           unstaged XY values described in the short format,
                           with unchanged indicated by a "." rather than
                           a space.
               <sub>       A 4 character field describing the submodule state.
                           "N..." when the entry is not a submodule.
                           "S<c><m><u>" when the entry is a submodule.
                           <c> is "C" if the commit changed; otherwise ".".
                           <m> is "M" if it has tracked changes; otherwise ".".
                           <u> is "U" if there are untracked changes; otherwise ".".
               <mH>        The octal file mode in HEAD.
               <mI>        The octal file mode in the index.
               <mW>        The octal file mode in the worktree.
               <hH>        The object name in HEAD.
               <hI>        The object name in the index.
               <X><score>  The rename or copy score (denoting the percentage
                           of similarity between the source and target of the
                           move or copy). For example "R100" or "C75".
               <path>      The pathname.  In a renamed/copied entry, this
                           is the target path.
               <sep>       When the `-z` option is used, the 2 pathnames are separated
                           with a NUL (ASCII 0x00) byte; otherwise, a tab (ASCII 0x09)
                           byte separates them.
               <origPath>  The pathname in the commit at HEAD or in the index.
                           This is only present in a renamed/copied entry, and
                           tells where the renamed/copied contents came from.
               --------------------------------------------------------

           Unmerged entries have the following format;
           the first character is a "u" to distinguish
           from ordinary changed entries.

               u <xy> <sub> <m1> <m2> <m3> <mW> <h1> <h2> <h3> <path>

               Field       Meaning

           Following the tracked entries (and if
           requested), a series of lines will be printed
           for untracked and then ignored items found in
           the worktree.

           Untracked items have the following format:

               ? <path>

           Ignored items have the following format:

               ! <path>

       PPaatthhnnaammee FFoorrmmaatt NNootteess aanndd --zz
           When the --zz option is given, pathnames are
           printed as is and without any quoting and
           lines are terminated with a NUL (ASCII 0x00)
           byte.

           Without the --zz option, pathnames with
           "unusual" characters are quoted as explained
           for the configuration variable ccoorree..qquuootteePPaatthh
           (see ggiitt--ccoonnffiigg(1)).

CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN
       The command honors ccoolloorr..ssttaattuuss (or ssttaattuuss..ccoolloorr
       — they mean the same thing and the latter is kept
       for backward compatibility) and
       ccoolloorr..ssttaattuuss..<<sslloott>> configuration variables to
       colorize its output.

       If the config variable ssttaattuuss..rreellaattiivveePPaatthhss is
       set to false, then all paths shown are relative
       to the repository root, not to the current
       directory.

       If ssttaattuuss..ssuubbmmoodduulleeSSuummmmaarryy is set to a non zero
       number or true (identical to -1 or an unlimited
       number), the submodule summary will be enabled
       for the long format and a summary of commits for
       modified submodules will be shown (see
       --summary-limit option of ggiitt--ssuubbmmoodduullee(1)).
       Please note that the summary output from the
       status command will be suppressed for all
       submodules when ddiiffff..iiggnnoorreeSSuubbmmoodduulleess is set to
       _a_l_l or only for those submodules where
       ssuubbmmoodduullee..<<nnaammee>>..iiggnnoorree==aallll. To also view the
       summary for ignored submodules you can either use
       the --ignore-submodules=dirty command line option
       or the _g_i_t _s_u_b_m_o_d_u_l_e _s_u_m_m_a_r_y command, which shows
       a similar output but does not honor these
       settings.

       By default, ggiitt ssttaattuuss will automatically refresh
       the index, updating the cached stat information
       from the working tree and writing out the result.
       Writing out the updated index is an optimization
       that isn’t strictly necessary (ssttaattuuss computes
       the values for itself, but writing them out is
       just to save subsequent programs from repeating
       our computation). When ssttaattuuss is run in the
       background, the lock held during the write may
       conflict with other simultaneous processes,
       causing them to fail. Scripts running ssttaattuuss in
       the background should consider using ggiitt
       ----nnoo--ooppttiioonnaall--lloocckkss ssttaattuuss (see ggiitt(1) for
       details).
